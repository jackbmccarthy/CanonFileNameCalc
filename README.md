## Introduction
This project is a File Name calculator for the Canon imageRunner Advance Devices. On the left hand side are your options, for a static text option, you can add the "Custom Text" option, all other options are generated by the machine.

On the top, will be an example of what the File Name will look like.

Down below, is the syntax the copier understands to create your custom file names. This syntax will need to be typed into the "File Name" field in the "Scan and Send" application on the Canon imageRunner Advance.
